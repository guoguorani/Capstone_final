    "## Scenario: \n",
    "#### Kiki got a new job in  San Francisco City, so she will move to SF City. The public transportation in SF is great and Kiki has enough time on the commute. Thus she does not need to stay near the company. However, Kiki needs to take her dogs for a walk in the parks and she also likes to do jogging in the park. Therefore, she prefers a place with most parks nearby.\n",

    "## Goal: \n",
    "#### Help Kiki find the place with most parks or gardens."
